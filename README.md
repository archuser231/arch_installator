Arch_linux_installator_with_Ncurses
Make it executable by doing:
$ chmod +x new_installer.sh
then 
$ sudo ./new_installer.sh
now you can install Archlinux easly and more faster (not sure but i think that if you're not obliged to read the Arch Wiki it will save time to your installation).
!!!!!!!!I assume that you're using the minimal-system-rescue.iso, because in this iso there's already  the dialog package wich is needed to run new_installer.sh!!!!!!!
